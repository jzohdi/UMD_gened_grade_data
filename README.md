# UMD Gen-Ed Search

This tool provides an interface for selecting course listings at University of Maryland for any semester than has been posted and then to sort the courses by gen ed fullfillment and average GPA.

Data from: https://app.testudo.umd.edu/soc/ and https://planetterp.com/

If the selected semester, year, and department have been selected before, the courses will be loaded from the database. Otherwise, the data is retrieved and then stored in the database for later use.
